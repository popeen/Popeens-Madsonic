Booksonic Server
===================

Booksonic aka Popeens Madsonic is a fork of the music streaming server Madsonic but with a twist.
While Subsonic and as far as I know all the other forks out there (including Madsonic) are focused on music, Booksonic, as the name suggests is focused on audiobooks.

So how do I use it to get book descriptions in the app?
Thats simple, in the folder of you book (or album if we use subsonic terms) you place a textfile called desc.txt. Anything you enter into this file will be reported by the api as a description of the book. 

And how about narrators?
It works just as with descriptions but the file is called reader.txt
